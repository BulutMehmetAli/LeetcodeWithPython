Enumerate() in Python

enumerate() function adds a counter to each item in a list or any other iterable, and returns a list of tuples containing the index position and the element for each element of the iterable.

It turns the iterable into something we can loop through using indexes, where each item comes with its number (starting from 0 by default).

a = ["Geeks", "for", "Geeks"]

# Iterating list using enumerate to get both index and element
for i, name in enumerate(a):
    print(f"Index {i}: {name}")
# Converting to a list of tuples
print(list(enumerate(a)))

In Python, the enumerate() function serves as an iterator, inheriting all associated iterator functions and methods.

We can use enumerate() with a dictionary to get both the index and its key-value pair:

d = {"a": 10, "b": 20, "c": 30}

# Enumerating through dictionary items
for index, (key, value) in enumerate(d.items()):
    print(index, "-", key, ":", value)

Enumerating a String
s = "python"
for i, ch in enumerate(s):
    print(f"Index {i}: {ch}")
